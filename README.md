# the implement of CNNH(Supervised Hashing for Image Retrieval via Image Representation Learning)
### it contains two stages: 
                       1,Learning approximate hash code
                       2,Learning image featrue representation and hash function
          
### problems still have: 
                       1,don't know the expression of loss function
                       2,don't know if need to batch or not
